This directory contains Chameleon, the operating system abstraction library.
It is written in C to be most portable.

Currently it is ported to Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Win32.
I'm planning to port it to PalmOS, too. 
That is not needed for LibChipCard, but I plan to use it with other 
projects, too.
